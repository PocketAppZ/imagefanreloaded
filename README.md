ImageFan Reloaded is a light-weight tab-based image viewer, supporting multi-core processing.

ImageFan Reloaded is available in two versions:
* __ImageFanReloaded-Avalonia__ - targets .NET 6 on Windows, Linux and macOS (requires .NET Runtime 6)
* __ImageFanReloaded-WPF__ - targets .NET Framework 4 Client Profile on Windows (requires .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, installed by default on Windows 8 and newer)

__ImageFanReloaded-Avalonia__ features mouse-only interaction, using the left and the right mouse buttons, and the mouse wheel:
* the left mouse button for selecting tabs, folders and images, and for opening, zooming in and out, and dragging images
* the right mouse button for returning from the opened image to the main view
* the mouse wheel for scrolling through folders and thumbnails, and for navigating back and forward through opened images

__ImageFanReloaded-WPF__, in addition to mouse interaction, also provides key-based interaction, using the keys:
* Tab for cycling though active tabs
* W-A-S-D, Up-Down-Left-Right, Backspace-Space and PageUp-PageDown for back and forward navigation through thumbnails and opened images
* Enter-Escape for entering into and exiting from image display modes
